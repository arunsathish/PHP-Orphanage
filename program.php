                    <li>UPHAAR - gift a smile</li>
                    <p>This project aims to bridge the gap between underprivileged street children and their counterparts. This provides you with an opportunity to put to good use the clothes or toys your child has outgrown. As we all know, toys play a significant role in a child's life both as a source of enjoyment and as a means of cognitive development. Many needy children are also deprived of cloths, the basic necessity. They wear same dirty worn out clothes repeatedly, which is not hygenic. Under this program we intend to collect toys & old usable clothes and distribute them among the needy children in an organized and systematic manner.</p>
